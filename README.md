DIANNE - Distributed Artificial Neural Networks
===============================================

DIANNE is a modular software framework for designing, evaluating and training artificial neural networks. It is built on top of [OSGi](http://www.osgi.org) and [AIOLOS](http://aiolos.intec.ugent.be) and can transparently deploy and redeploy (parts of) a neural network on multiple machines.
