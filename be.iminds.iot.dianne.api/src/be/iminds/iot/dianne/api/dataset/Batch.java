/**
 * A helper class for representing a batch of a dataset, a combination of
 * a (batched) input and target Tensor
 * 
 * In a batch, the input/target from Sample represents all batches in a single 
 * Tensor with dim 0 = batchSize. Separate Tensors per sample are available in 
 * the inputSamples/targetSamples arrays. 
 * 
 * In case the Dataset has variable input dims, a single batched Tensor is 
 * impossible to construct, in which case input/target are null and the inputSamples
 * targetSamples arrays contain separate Tensor objects for each sample in the batch.
